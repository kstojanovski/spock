# Spock
Testing Spock as unit test framework for Java projects.

The motivation about Spock came from an dzone article where Spock was mentioned as tool which any developer needs to know.
Beside that I have learned more about Spock by reading examples and documentation from the following web sites: 

* Petri Kainulainen - https://www.petrikainulainen.net/
* Kostis Kapelonis - http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/using-spock-to-test-groovy-and-java-applications/
* Spock documentation - http://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.1-rc-2/index.html
* Spock example project - https://github.com/spockframework/spock-example
